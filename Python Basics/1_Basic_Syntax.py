# syntax - correct arrangement of words and symbols
# semantic - interpretation, what the code is supposed to do when it runs

'''

# basic syntax  rules:
    - case sensitivity
    - indentation
    - line continuation [ t=1+2+3+\
                           4+5]
    - multiple statements in single line [x=5; y=3; z=x+y]

    
# semantic in python:
    - variable assignmet (kernel automatically understands)
    - type inference (during run time) [var=10
                                        var='abc']
